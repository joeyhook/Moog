# Moog
Virtual Moog synth in Max/MSP with filter plugin

main.maxpat and all voices and preset file should be in the same directory.

The plugin included here is 64-bit Mac VST. If you need another type you can build it from the JUCE project.

When opening main.maxpat for the first time the filter plugin should be loaded into the vst~ object by clicking 
the 'plug' message, then 'open' to see the gui (if you like), then select a preset or start from the baseline 
(most every feature off).
